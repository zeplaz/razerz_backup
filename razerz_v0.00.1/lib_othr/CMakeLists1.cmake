on the state and condition of emergent art and ethics, AI, and democratization of tools.
 Et alla RE:  c, grimes + Zola Jesus + Devon Welsh + D'eon+sould elya join in?YES
  intro:



  also some msucians hate touring and liveshows. Bach never had to tour.
   soo i see it less as an exreme, "wont have to" vs. wont exist. personal
   i prefer live shows. but then i also like hidaway composerz soo we should
   have a world where BOTH aveune produce livehoods. and arnt foced by the evil
    industy to do one or the other.

  Thus the question is what are we doing to democratize AI.
  on the state and condition of emergent art and ethics, AI, and democratization
  of tools. Et alla RE:  c, grimes + Zola Jesus + Devon Welsh + D'eon
  As to AI.
  ya i think building and engaging with AI that's like, about things other than
  productivity, akla making AI that's about doing creative or emergent happy, or
  positive things.(or empathetic) i mean, i think there is the "AI in the sense of machine learning"
   which these days is used for nothing but business and striping humanity. i think 1stly
    that kind of soft AI should ya be more focused on being used to seek out and act out more positive aspects
     of humanity and the world. and tragred to more human connection and machine-human connections which
      is not just profit-productivity etc. then there's the whole "emergent AI" which
       i think should be seen as more a nearly religious concept of other intelligence but not seen as some
  otalizing evil or built to control, just existence as though throughout the
   system that is just as fallible and multiplicable as their are peoples,
    or beings. and should be focused wards positive and such. i think the
    view common that AI is somehow cold inhuman and without any kind of
    empathy is BS> we should be trying to build empathetic soft AI and
    hope and design a world which would encourage the emergence of
    empathetic hard AI. vs all the bs we do these days and all the popular
     notions. and abuse it is used for .

  The fact is that the production of art requires more than just the means
  of production, or rather the means of production for aesthetic object
  hinges on more than just access to tools. Tools are valuable and easy of access
   and is a part, but a small part, someone who wants to make art, will
   make it, with whatever it is that they can find. However, there are three other
   much more important aspects of the production of art, 1) is that the creator believes
   that their work will have an audience(the need for the artist to believe the work will be consumed,
      is paramount to the process of creating aesthetic artifacts artist did not create works and hid them
       in floor boards of their datchas, in totalitarian regimes cuz they thought nobody would see it.),
       weather tomorrow or in the future. 2) they have the means to live, that means cost of living,
   access to food, water, and shelter, are far more important. As well
   as a “safe place to produce”. I can have all the tools I want, but,
   if I play clarinet, or sing to loud, the nabour call the authorities,
      and armed men come to my door to stop it. Same goes for many emergent
       artist venues, noise ordinances laws have been come striker and more
       enforced, this basically makes production and sharing of art impossible,
        and crlimizled, for emergent artist it's important to “share”
         their work with others often in a live setting to gauge reaction.
  Through the digital medium provides another channel of communication,
   it too has become far more restrictive environment.

  Example is some young emerging extremely talented woman artists in mtl,
   whos, perform, and also currasted events, and studios, yet,
    they could not keep studios open, as rent in mtl has gone up alot, Plus,
    attendance to their shows went down, as they can't get people to come out,
     are people interested? Hardly, people who do showup are always impressed.
     Its that the means to let people know its happening are completely cut off,
      without paying the social media or, producing works which fit into
       the  “what is going to sell” or popular, their event pages, their posts
       and tweets, and bandcamps or whatever, are suppressed into oblivion,
       thus, they have poor attendance people don't even see the event page,
        thus the emergent and underground promoters and artists have lost their
         ability to communicate with their audience which is paramount to their
         ability to both feel validated for their work as well as you know generate
         revenue to live. The fact is particular in north america, being an artist
         is far harder and far worse condition than it was historically. Funding
          is less, and complex(grant writing requires huge amounts of effort with no gartine
            and does not support some kinds of work). The industry is very tightly controlled.
            And the means for sharing particular in a IRL setting is met with armed suppression, and fines.


  Simple fact is after 11 years of being an artist (as of 3 days ago!). My work
  now has less exposure then it did years ago, it's fine to say I have the tools
  to make more, but what's the point? I have boxes full of manuscripts, 1000 google
  documents of plays, poems, and lyrics. 100s of hours of sound recordings,
   hours and hours of films and other projects. But they get no views, no revenue, no exposure.
    Yet they exist. They'd probably be better off hidden in the floorboards.
    In that regards, Solzhenitsyn, had it better. Currently I live in a small
    remote town, whose primary language is not my own, and  I rely on the internet
    to keep in contact with freinds, and family;  basically the support needed
    to stay sane, alive and semi productive. But as for my work, I no longer even
    have a passport cuz I can’t afford one.                  And I          recall, artists of the 20ths century

     lamenting how there abusive governments would deny them travel, well.. I;m denied travel,
     economic censorship or agrathmic centureship is still censorship if anything its far more drect curler.

  My argument comes from both 11 years as an artist, 4 years as an underground emerging artist
   venue managing director and promoter, backed by a degree in information technology with a
   minor in economics and a concentration in arts administration and followed with continued
   contact with local and  international emerging and undroung artist and promoters both new,
   young and old. .. aka. I have both the professional and academic authority on the matter
   of “the state of emergent art” today.


























yekov responce.

ah no, i find the extreme idleogical views to be offsive and minmilst.
nor do i think he is evil. i think such a notion is malplaced.
do i think he's a narsisit sure, a sosopath... not in the way they mean,
does he lack personal empathy ? in some fasions for sure, but, that rarely somthing that
you can falt someone for, it makes then hard to deal with, and abit broken and dangruse with power though
but findebltiyy their not going out of their way to hurt people in that same way, they lack  the ablity
to epathize twards another,for them,, they can only presive how their actions would effect them, if they themsleves.
  did it. to themsleves,, which limits their emotional sprecturm of respoce to partticlar persona conduct.
  and their ablity to see the other side. which in a complex persian conflcit is prity key,
  andd ya.. i mena their prity rascist, a maesgnist etc. but thats a personal, opnion of the man,
  and i dont think the man makes the sitation. patilcar when it comes to executive power.
  did he hold hit iran in his pocket since election day? of course. but,
  for someone like me who's studied policy and partilcay US govemrnet polcie process.
  this isncudles.. around an inpeachment thing, or any majorc change to exeuctive power,
  they often will, esclate a active conflcit. cliton didi it, others have, for less exrtreme
  legisltave threats then an impeachment. personally the evil one is mich mconnel.  he is a person
  who genuly gets satfcation off suffering. trump is oblivus and ingrant, hes not into causing pain,
  and he genucly cares about his supporters. even if he thinks their rabble. and pawns for him todepoy
    he still DOES want to make them happy.

    this issue we would look at is policy impact, forget it was trump. i take the more tolsty view of history
    anywzh and grand men is a hevely dismised notion, its a instuaitonal envromen and body poltic that make,
    and executire posion and fill that posison with often their worst manfestions.
